[...]
template:
spec:
containers:
- name: app-container
image: training/main-application:0.1 
- name: web-container
image: nginx:1.7.9
containerPort: 80

And the container extension found in the file "web-preview-container-extension.yaml":
 
spec:
template:
spec:
containers:
- name: web-preview-container
image: training/web-preview:0.1
containerPort: 80

A cluster administrator patched the "deployment/multi-container-app" with an extra container by issuing the command:

kubectl patch deployment multi-container-app --patch "$(cat web-preview-container-extension.yaml)" --type=strategic

The command returns an error. Why?


The container from the extension file is binding to port 80 which is already used in the web-container container from the deployment.

You deleted the PersistentVolumeClaim and released the volume. How can you reclaim the volume?
Because the PersistentVolume still exists, delete it along with the data from the linked storage asset and the asset itself.

What is the first step to take in a canary deployment in Kubernetes?
Ensure that the Service does not have a version selector.

Which option must you set while creating a CronJob object to handle timezones?

spec:
   accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
   volumeMode: block
   resources:
     requests:
       storage: 8Gi
   storageClassName: slow 
What will happen if you mount the PVC slow-storage-pvc to a new Pod demo-application-2 under the same file system path as demo-application-1? 


The operation will fail because the ReadWriteOnce access mode restricts other Pods from mounting the PVC.

What purpose does the --dry-run option flag serve when running the command: kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-application-demo --to-revision=2 --dry-run?

If set, the command only prints the object that would be sent without changing the cluster state.

Your company must connect a containerized application with a Redis database running outside Kubernetes. The application container is trying to connect to a Redis instance running on localhost. How can you use the ambassador container design pattern instead of a direct connection to the Redis database?

You can use an ambassador container as a secondary container in the Pod, launching a proxy application that is forwarding requests from the localhost connection to a remote Redis server.


You must create an endpoint for a Service with no selector. Which loopback endpoint IP (IPv4) can you choose?
192.0.0.0
You have a MongoDB server running in a Pod at port number 34121. You must access the database from your local system which means you require port forwarding. How will you achieve the task without choosing the port number manually?

Ambassador
You are working on an application that depends on a third-party service. When the application boots, it must perform a long-running handshake with the third party before it can successfully handle requests. How would you implement this in Kubernetes?
Implement a readiness probe that checks if the third-party handshake was successful. Kubernetes will automatically handle the flow of traffic to the Pods.
 
You do not want to use the default service account for your Pod so you set the name of your custom service account in the spec.serviceAccountName field. Your custom service account is rejected, however. What could be the possible explanation?

The custom service account was not created when the Pod was created.
You created a Deployment with five replicas using the command kubectl apply -f https://eg.com/demo/controllers/dep.yaml. How can you verify if all five replicas are ready in the Deployment?
Run kubectl get deployments and check if the AVAILABLE label has the number five in it.
As a namespace administrator, you need ultimate control over deployment security, but must allow your developers to configure within a range. How can you do this?
Implement a security policy on the cluster and use securityContext in deployments as normal.
Why is Service an optional field in the Kubernetes web user interface (UI) deploy wizard?
Because not every application needs to expose a Service to an external IP address

You are generating Kubernetes resources using kompose. You use the following kompose labels in your docker-compose.yaml file:

kompose.volume.size as 1Gi for the requests storage’s size in the PersistentVolumeClaim
kompose.service.type as node to designate the service to be created
kompose.controller.type as daemonset to convert the deployment upon creation

When you run kompose convert, the command fails. Why is this?
You must define the kompose.service.type as nodeport instead.
Your service is just one part of a microservices application. The microservice you wrote cannot handle the volume of traffic in the production cluster because it maxed out its resource constraints. Your application is deployed using the following definition. What is the most likely solution?
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
labels:
run: process-order-api
name: process-order-api
spec:
containers:
- image: company/processorder
name: procesorder
Redeploy the applications as a Kubernetes Deployment with a ReplicaSet set to a minimum of two.
After creating the resources with the following PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and PersistentVolume (PV) definition running on a Kubernetes cluster, the PVC is still unbound. Why?

spec:
accessModes:
- ReadWriteOnce
volumeMode: Filesystem
storageClassName: Recyclable
resources:

And the file named log-exporter-container-extension.yaml:

spec:
template:
spec:
containers:
- name: log-exporter-container
image: training/log-exporter:0.1

After you create a live deployment object named deployment/multi-container-app from the template, you run an update by issuing the command:

kubectl patch deployment multi-container-app --patch "$(cat log-exporter-container-extension.yaml)" --type=strategic

What is the outcome?
It will add the log-exporter-container to the list of containers in the deployment template object and will trigger a rolling update on the deployment instance.
What purpose does the --dry-run option flag serve when running the command: kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-application-demo --to-revision=2 --dry-run?
If set, the command only prints the object that would be sent without changing the cluster state.

type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
credentials:
  username: explorer      
  password: sfdjl44SD3425
On running the script, you notice invalid user credentials. Why?

You have stored user credentials in credentials instead of stringData.



 
You passed a certain value to both the dataSourceRef and the dataSource fields. This leads to an error by the dataSourceRef field. You confirm the value of the object to be demo.kubernetes.ex. What is the cause of the error?
The object doesn't belong to any of the available apiGroup values.

You deleted the PersistentVolumeClaim and released the volume. How can you reclaim the volume?
Because the PersistentVolume still exists, delete it along with the data from the linked storage asset and the asset itself.

A microservice you engineered contains endpoints that persist information to a database. In your application, a component of the Kubernetes container logic handles the final issuing of the calls. When the database call is made, the data to be persisted is sanitized, transformed, and injected into the database. The application handles sanitization and transformation. As the deployed application runs, resiliency testing is performed, but when containers are shut down, calls are dropped and do not experience a retry. Why is this?
Generally, containers should be treated as ephemeral. Therefore, the microservice should handle the final issuing of calls, not the container. 




You want to fetch out the stable release and track the records weekly. To do so, you create two labels as follows:
release!=stable

kubectl create configmap myconfig --from-env-file=./appconfig.txt

What is true of a Service in Kubernetes?
A service is a representational state transfer (REST) object similar to a Pod.

An application is working for the past half hour but is not progressing. You suspect the application never started successfully so you use a startup probe to check when it was started. This doesn't resolve the issue, however. What else can you do to make the application progress?
•  Your choice: correct -
Use a liveness probe to catch any deadlock present in the application and restart it.

11.
 
You are working on an application that depends on a third-party service. When the application boots, it must perform a long-running handshake with the third party before it can successfully handle requests. How would you implement this in Kubernetes?

Your choice: correct -
Name-based virtual hosting

Incorrect -
Port forwarding

Incorrect -
Cluster protection

Incorrect -
Pod security

Incorrect -
I don't know yet.

2. Why is Service an optional field in the Kubernetes web user interface (UI) deploy wizard?
Incorrect -
Because not every application necessarily contains a Service

Correct -
Because not every application needs to expose a Service to an external IP address

Your choice: incorrect -
Because Pods with Service resources are deployed as resource objects

Incorrect -
Because the dedicated resources for Services are expensive and thereby optional

Incorrect -
I don't know yet.

Incorrect -
The ability to communicate with inter process communication (IPC)

Correct -
The ability to find each other with localhost

Incorrect -
I don't know yet.

4. What does a Kubernetes cluster IP do?
Correct -
Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP; choosing this makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster

Your choice: incorrect -
Exposes the Service on an internal virtual multicast IP address that all the Pods listen to; choosing this makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster but ignores all namespacing

Incorrect -
Exposes the service on a new IP that is shared using multicast between all the worker nodes; choosing this makes the Service accessible outside the cluster

Incorrect -
Exposes the Service on a worker node's network address; choosing this makes the Service accessible outside the cluster

Incorrect -
I don't know yet.

5. A Pod named demo-application-1 is mounting the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) called slow-storage-pvc, which has the following definition:

Incorrect -
The operation will succeed and mount the shared PVC to the new Pod under the specified file system path.

Incorrect -
The operation will fail because the PVC is mounted under the same file system in the Pods.

Your choice: incorrect -
The operation will fail because the volumeMode attribute is set to block and should be set to filesystem.

Correct -
The operation will fail because the ReadWriteOnce access mode restricts other Pods from mounting the PVC.

Incorrect -
I don't know yet.

Your choice: incorrect -
Because the node is full and cannot handle the Pod

Correct -
Because of insufficient resources in the Pod of one type or another

Incorrect -
I don't know yet.

9. Why is it uncommon to create individual Pods, including singleton Pods, in Kubernetes? 
Correct -
Because Pods are designed to have a relatively short life span and are disposable entities 

Your choice: incorrect -
Because Pods are durable by design, so you should only configure them as a subset of Deploy resources

Incorrect -
Because Pods share resources and there should always be a configuration of two or more

Incorrect -
Because Pods contain state and therefore need another Pod to hold and preserve that state

Incorrect -
I don't know yet.

13. You restart your application and it is not serving the traffic for the first five seconds. You analyze the issue and the delay is because of the app's dependencies on a few external services after its startup. To resolve the issue, you create a startup probe as follows:
startupProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - cat
    - /tmp/healthy
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
This doesn't resolve the issue, however. What changes must you make in the code so Kubernetes Services do not send traffic to the Pod until it is ready to receive?
Incorrect -
Use failureThreshold instead of initialDelaySeconds.

Incorrect -
Use a liveness probe instead of a startup probe.

Incorrect -
Use failureThreshold instead of periodSeconds.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: user--profile-deployment
    labels:
        app: user-profile
        version: 1.02
spec:
    replicas: 4
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: user-profile
    template:
    metadata:
        labels:
            app: user-profile
            version: 1.02
    spec:
        containers:
        - name: userprofile
          image: user-profile:1.02
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
and creates a derivative for the new version:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: user--profile-deployment
    labels:
        app: user-profile
        version: 1.03

    containers:
    - name: userprofile
      image: user-profile:1.03
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
The new version of the application works and a blue/green style switch happens on the Ingress controller to complete the deployment, but error rates start to increase. What is the most likely explanation? 
Incorrect -
The new code is not as efficient. Roll back and re-evaluate the code changes for performance issues.

Incorrect -
The version numbers are mismatched in the Ingress controller with the new deployment version.

Incorrect -
The cluster needs an additional worker node to run the extra containers.

Kubernetes is self-healing so if a node fails, the Pods will restart across deployed clusters.

Incorrect -
Kubernetes is self-dependent so any security patches released are automatically applied to all nodes, including the worker nodes and working container images.

Incorrect -
Kubernetes is self-defending so if a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs, it detects it and denylists the traffic.

A microservice you engineered contains endpoints that persist information to a database. In your application, a component of the Kubernetes container logic handles the final issuing of the calls. When the database call is made, the data to be persisted is sanitized, transformed, and injected into the database. The application handles sanitization and transformation. As the deployed application runs, resiliency testing is performed, but when containers are shut down, calls are dropped and do not experience a retry. Why is this?
Incorrect -
Generally, Pods should be treated as ephemeral. Therefore, a separate service should handle data sanitization and transformation, not the microservice in question.
